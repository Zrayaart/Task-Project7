Task Manager is a productivity app that helps you stay organized and on top of your to-do list. 
With Task Manager, you can easily add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. 
The app features a persistent session, ensuring that your tasks are saved even when you close the app, 
and offers a convenient calendar view for a more visual and organized approach to task management.
